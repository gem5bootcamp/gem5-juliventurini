### Homework 3
I could not get the secure memory running due to the fact that the scope of the excercise exceeds my knowledge on the suject matter. 
If I were able to get it running I would have compared its performance (namely, simulation time , hit ratios) and compared it to a non secure model to see the change. 
Likely, the secure memory would have been much less effective since it needs to traverse the Merkel tree and do all the verifications before returning any values, hence increasing simulation time.
